# Enable Logging Switch for Testing

**Do not modify this rule unless explicitly instructed.**

## Purpose (for the AI)

This rule is **for the AI**: when you work on logic that has a `LOGGING_SWITCH` (or similar) constant, **you** should enable the relevant switch(es) in the files that implement that logic so the user can see debug output in `server.log` and verify behavior.

## What to do

1. **Enable the right switches**: Set `LOGGING_*SWITCH = true` in the file(s) that contain the logic you are changing or that are relevant to the task (e.g. game clearing, mode switching, Dutch game helpers, queen peek, Jack swap, etc.). Do not enable everywhere—only where it helps trace the current task.
2. Add or keep `if (LOGGING_SWITCH) { ... }` log calls where they help trace the paths you care about.
3. Logs go to `python_base_04/tools/logger/server.log` (or the configured logger output).

## Where LOGGING_SWITCH appears

- Flutter/Dart: `flutter_base_05/lib/modules/dutch_game/**/*.dart` (helpers, coordinators, round, managers, event emitter, etc.)
- Dart backend: `dart_bkend_base_01/**/*.dart`
- Python: `python_base_04/**/*.py`
- Match the switch to the logic: e.g. game clearing / mode switching / leave_room → helpers, game_coordinator, validated_event_emitter, player_action.
