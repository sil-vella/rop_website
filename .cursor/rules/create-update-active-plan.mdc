# Create/Update Active Plan

## Overview

This rule guides the agent to maintain active implementation plans in `/Users/sil/Documents/Work/reignofplay/Dutch/app_dev/Documentation/00_Active_plans`. Plans document current implementation work and must be kept up-to-date as changes occur.

## When to Create a New Plan

Create a new active plan when:
- Starting a new feature implementation
- Beginning work on a new module or component
- Initiating a significant refactoring effort
- Starting a multi-step development task

## When to Update an Existing Plan

Update the existing plan when:
- Making modifications to the current implementation
- Completing steps in the implementation
- Changing approach or direction
- Adding new requirements or constraints
- Fixing bugs or issues discovered during implementation

## Plan File Location

All active plans must be stored in:
```
/Users/sil/Documents/Work/reignofplay/Dutch/app_dev/Documentation/00_Active_plans/
```

## Plan File Naming

Use descriptive, kebab-case names:
- `feature-name-implementation.md`
- `module-name-refactor.md`
- `bug-fix-description.md`

## Plan Structure

Each plan should include:

1. **Title**: Clear description of what's being implemented
2. **Status**: Current state (In Progress, Completed, On Hold, etc.)
3. **Objective**: What the implementation aims to achieve
4. **Steps/Tasks**: Breakdown of implementation steps
5. **Current Progress**: What has been completed
6. **Next Steps**: What needs to be done next
7. **Files Modified**: List of files changed during implementation
8. **Notes**: Any important considerations or decisions

## Workflow

1. **At Start**: Check if a relevant plan exists in `00_Active_plans/`
   - If no plan exists → Create a new plan file
   - If plan exists → Review and update it

2. **During Implementation**: After each significant modification:
   - Update the "Current Progress" section
   - Add any new files to "Files Modified"
   - Update "Next Steps" if priorities change
   - Add notes about decisions or issues encountered

3. **On Completion**: Mark plan as completed and archive if needed

## Example Plan Template

```markdown
# [Feature/Module Name] Implementation Plan

**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: [Date]  
**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Objective
[Clear description of what this implementation achieves]

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Step 1: [Description]
- [x] Step 2: [Description] ✅
- [ ] Step 3: [Description]

## Current Progress
[What has been completed so far]

## Next Steps
[What needs to be done next]

## Files Modified
- `path/to/file1.dart`
- `path/to/file2.py`

## Notes
[Important decisions, issues, or considerations]
```

## Important Reminders

- **Always update the plan** after making code changes
- **Keep the plan current** - outdated plans are not useful
- **Be specific** about what was changed and why
- **Document decisions** that affect the implementation approach
